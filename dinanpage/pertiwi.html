<p><font color="Green"><p style="text-indent: 45px;">The pandemic known as Covid-19 has been going on for one year.  Last March, the first 2 cases in Indonesia 
were announced. Some people panicked and started preparing for a massive quarantine,some were still in disbelief,
while some thought everything was going on as usual, as if there was nothing to be afraid of.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 45px;">Various stories whispered around Indonesia during the pandemic. Of course, everyone hopes that this pandemic does not need another birthday. But, during this new normal, there are also new hopes and prayers, a hope that we can survive, a hope that we can fight hard, a hope that we are able to go through all this until the pandemic is over.
